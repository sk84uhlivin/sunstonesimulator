## sunstonesimulator

This program is designed to simulate going through the Giza Plains to do the Sun Stone quest in the game "Final Fantasy XII". Really only useful for a speedrun, and only for demonstration purposes, but cool nonetheless.

Requires one non-standard library that can be pip installed by doing:

    pip install plotly==4.7.1

Otherwise, `sunstonesimulator.py` is designed for doing 1 simulation, while `plotter.py` is used for multiple simulations and plotting.
